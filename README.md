# Starting-Out
My first Python projects
Testing out Github for the first time. This is where I'll explain experiments. 
About me: LSE graduate with a China specialisation, initially interested in economics, stats, pure math. I don't know where this will take me but I'm hoping to get employment coding Python for statistical analysis â€“ or something like that.
