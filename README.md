# Starting-Out

My first Python procedures

The first repository file I created is 'beginner procedures and projects'. Here I demonstrate simple code exercises that I'm writing to get familiar with Python procedures. Many of these exercises are from the Book Learn Python in one day: [Python for beginners, with hands-on projects.](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-One-Well-Hands/dp/1546488332/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518364938&sr=8-3&keywords=Learn+Python+in+one+day&dpID=51iNedkheKL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

Beginner procedures1 covers:
- Variables and operators
- Assignment operators
- Assigning values to variables
- Data types (integers, floats, strings)
- Type casting
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- Interactive procedures
- Control flow tools:  
  - conditions, for loop and if statements
  - while loop, break, continue
  - try, except and errortypes
- Functions
- Variable scope
- Modules
  - importing modules
  - creating your own module
<br></br>

IDLEuploadtest is a file uploaded from the IDLE program. I uploaded it to see if git retains some of the color coding and the .py file extension. It does. This makes reading and changing the Python code in Github much easier. 

Beginner procedures2 is my second set of simple exercises. It includes:
- opening and reading an external .txt file
- read and write with buffering control on external file
- adapt buffering procedure to output a binary file
- rename and remove
<br></br>

The Classes and objects file uses some of the procedures and definitions learned so far to build simple structure with object oriented programming methods. It includes:
- defining a class and instantiating objects in the class
- methods (in-class procedures)
- properties 
- name mangling
- single instances and the self parameter
- instance, class and static methods

Codeblocks uses a class inheritance demo to practice better presentation of Python code in Github. 

The three Math-Binary files complete my Starting Out project. They are the code I wrote for the final game project in Learn Python in One Day. Mostly the code turned out to match the source code for the project, but I have maintained my own (less good) code in places, with notes on mistakes or improvements. 

With the syntax basics for Python intact, I am moving on to the MIT open course [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) taught by Grimson, Guttag and Bell. I'll document my progress through the course in the nicely iterative MIT: CS & PP Repo.
