# Starting-Out

My first Python projects

Testing out Github for the first time. This is where I'll explain experiments. 

About me: LSE graduate with a China specialisation, initially interested in economics, stats, pure math. I don't know where this will take me but I'm hoping to get employment coding Python for statistical analysis â€“ or something like that. 


The first repository file I created is 'beginner procedures and projects'. Here I have cut & paste simple code exercises that I'm using to get familiar with Python procedures. Many of these exercises are from the Book Learn Python in one day: [Python for beginners, with hands-on projects.](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-One-Well-Hands/dp/1546488332/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518364938&sr=8-3&keywords=Learn+Python+in+one+day&dpID=51iNedkheKL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

Covered so far:
- Variables and operators
- Assignment operators
- Assigning values to variables
- Data types (integers, floats, strings)
- Type casting
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- Interactive procedures
- Control flow tools:  
  - conditions, for loop and if statements
  - while loop, break, continue
