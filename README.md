# Starting-Out

My first Python projects

Testing out Github for the first time. This is where I'll explain experiments. 

About me: LSE graduate with a China specialisation, initially interested in economics, stats, pure math. I don't know where this will take me but I'm hoping to get employment coding Python for statistical analysis â€“ or something like that. 


The first repository file I created is 'beginner projects and procedures'. Here I have cut & paste simple code exercises that I'm using to get familiary with Python procedures. Many of these exercises are from the Book "Learn Python in one day: Python for beginners, with hands-on projects".
